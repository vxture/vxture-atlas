   * product_210 §4.1a (2026-07-28, platform#173 - the fix for TD-015):
   * where to actually call this tool. `path` is relative to Atlas's own base
   * URL, which a consumer already has from its own config/registry - it must
   * never become a second place a hostname lives.
   *
   * This is what let TD-013's path retirement have gone undetected by
   * discovery: the manifest was byte-identical before and after, so a
   * consumer polling it learned nothing until the next real call 404'd.
